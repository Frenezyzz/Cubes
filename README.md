# Cubes

This is a Cube game project with enemies implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to hit the enemies with the cube player and destroy the enemies to score points. If an enemy touches the cube player, you gain a point. The game continues until the score goes below zero, generating new enemies when all have been destroyed.

You just need to move with the arrows keys.
